# battery-notification3.0
 A simple and complete battery notification script 

This is a script to notify you that your laptop needs to be plugged in.

From [version 2.0](https://github.com/enigmatic-system/battery-notification2.0) I've added a "Battery charged" notification.

  - Critical level notification at 10%

  - Normal level notification at 15%

  - Low level notification at 20%

  - Battery fully charged notification at 100%

This script works with notify-send and I use Dunst as the notification daemon.
